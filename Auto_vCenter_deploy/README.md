# Sinle Touch vCenter Installation
## Description
This repository will help you to do single touch vCenter installation by modifying a variable file in `terraform.tfvars` and then run the code to setup your vCenter very soon. 

## üé• Video Demo on Youtube
In near future

## Technologies and Tools
To implement this project, I only used Terraform and VMware vCenter product iso file. This method tested with vCenter 8.  

‚úÖ `Terraform`

‚úÖ `vCenter product iso file`

## Project Requirements
‚≠ê An ESXi host

‚≠ê A linux server to run Terraform on it.

‚≠ê Muont vCenter iso file on your linux server.

## Start to Use this code
### Step 1: Transfer codes to you Ansible Server
&#9745; To clone this repository from my GitHub using the command line, you can use the following command:
````
git clone https://github.com/salehmiri90/VMware_Automation.git
````

&#9745; Use the 'cd' command to get into the contents of the cloned directory 'VMware_Automation' and this project realted directory 'Auto_vCenter_deploy' as follows: 
````
cd VMware_Automation/Auto_vCenter_deploy
````

&#9745; And then listing the contents with the command: 
````
ll
````

### Step 2: Defining Hosts Variables
&#9745; Set a hostname for your Windows server on your control node's hosts file located in `vi /etc/hosts`. For example:
````
192.168.1.1  windows-template
````
### Step 3: Execution
&#9745; Modify `terraform.tfvars` file and set the correct variables based on your infrastracture and environment.
